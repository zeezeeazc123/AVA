# AVA Outline V1

## Basic Plot

1. A man lives with his wife (best friend).

2. When having sex, she (her AVA) realizes that he's not interested in her, even though the Dynasty paired them as compatible mates.

3. She and the Man go "off the grid" in the attempts to slow the "phantom" process.

4. They are both headhunted. The wife is captured, her AVA torn out and replaced for a new one. The man is left for dead, his AVA broken.

5. He awakens in a laboratory with old AVA experiments and preserved humanoid subjects that are more "natural" than himself. There, he meets a gypsie scientist who believes he is the future. The man learns how the AVAs were developed and constructed.

7. The only way for the man to preserve his identity is to "Merge" with someone and start his own network, as that was how the Merovingian Dynasty was born. This is only doable with the old technology which includes a custom test subject.

8. Taking a blue test subject, the Man sets out to return to the city and find his wife's broken AVA.

9. Re-entering the sphere of the network, the man is head hunted again.

10. They both find the AVA, but it is already erased (therefore, it will take the identity of anybody it is installed into)

11. Inexplicably, the man still wants to do the Merge with the blue man under the pretense that is their only option. Both merge, and for the first time, the man's AVA is seen to have worked properly. Gunshot.

12. Flash forward, Joseph finds in his "son's" room a model of a blue man. Angrily, he argues that the Blue Man represents the knowledge that could have been. However, he can't bring himself to destroy the model. Instead, he heads to the most ancient church in town. END
